	Mouskeys, Joykeys, Clock, SideWind, and Slowdown

I think that would be OK, as long as it is free.  I would just ask that
you make sure it includes the latest version of MOUSKEYS (v3.05 as of
today), and that you consider possibly including some of my other
programs as well.

	EP-320X-S

Dear Blair,

You are welcomed to use the DOS packet driver files of the EP-320X-S Fast
Ethernet network adapter freely for the FreeDOS project as long as the
FreeDOS project is free and opened, and the driver files themselves included
in the future FreeDOS project shall not be held for any responsibility
caused correspondingly.

Please understand also that we will not make any guarantees, explicit or
implicit, about the compatibility, reliability and stability of DOS packet
driver files on the FreeDOS project.

Thank you with my best regards.

Sincerely yours,
Richer Lu

Subject: EP-320X-S

Hello.  I am compiling together a FreeDOS distribution
(http://www.freedos.org), and for the sake of giving the user the greatest
satasfaction and ease of use, I would like to include the DOS packet driver
of the EP-320X-S on the CD-ROM.  The driver will be used in an autodetection
process to allow a user to easily put their FreeDOS installation on the
internet.  Since there is no licence included with the packet driver, I
would like your kind permission to distribute your EP-320X-S on my free
CD-ROM along with the other open-source and freely distributable software on
the CD-ROM.

Thank you for your time,

Blair Campbell

Hi.  I am compiling a FreeDOS distribution (http://www.freedos.org),
and for the sake of maximum user friendliness, would like to include
your Realtek 8139 DOS packet driver with my distribution.  As there is
no specifics about redistribution included with the Realtek driver, I
would like to have permission to distribute this driver on my free
CD-ROM.

Thank you for your time,
